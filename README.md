Algorithm 1 is designed in brute force approach with O(n^3) complexity. Using dynamic
programming it is further improvised to O(n^2) complexity in Algorithm 2.
It is further improved to O(n) complexity in Algorithm 3. This is done by recursive formulation
by dynamic programming.
Algorithm 4 is written in a naive approach with O(n^6) complexity with basic knowledge. In
Algorithm 5 it is improvised to O(n^4) complexity using dynamic programming. By recursive
formulation of dynamic programming it is further improve to O(n^3) complexity in Algorithm 6.
